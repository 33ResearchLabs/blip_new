## What is Blip Money?

**Blip Money** is a peer-to-peer (P2P) platform that lets anyone instantly convert cryptocurrency to cash (and vice versa) by connecting them directly with verified local traders.

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Contract Escrow

**What it does:** Locks crypto in a secure blockchain vault until both parties confirm the trade is complete.

**Why it matters:** Neither party can be scammed - the money can only go to the rightful recipient.

```
